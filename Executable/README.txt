Seasons

Seasons is a Windows application created using DirectX 10. It has been designed and constructed to demonstrate the graphical capabilities of DirectX 10 
through the use of effect files utilising pixel and vertex shaders, stencil and depth buffering, lighting, the use of textures and materials, 
world, view and projection transformations, and user interaction with the mouse and keyboard.
